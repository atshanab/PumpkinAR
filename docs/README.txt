PumpkinAR /docs deployment pack

FILES
- docs/index.html         A simple page with a big "Open in AR" button
- docs/redirect.html      Auto-redirects straight to the USDZ (fallback button included)

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
1) Put your USDZ file into the same /docs folder and name it EXACTLY:
   Halloween_Cursed_Pumpkin.usdz

2) In GitHub repo settings:
   Settings → Pages → Source = "Deploy from branch"
   Branch = main, Folder = /docs
   Save. Wait ~1–2 minutes for deploy.

3) Public URLs (after deploy):
   - Home page:   https://atshanab.github.io/PumpkinAR/
   - Redirect:    https://atshanab.github.io/PumpkinAR/redirect.html
   - Direct USDZ: https://atshanab.github.io/PumpkinAR/Halloween_Cursed_Pumpkin.usdz

QR CODES
- Use the redirect QR for lowest friction (opens USDZ automatically in Safari).
